📦 Crops analyzed: 8

— Crop 1 (region 5): crops/scan_1762183600/scan_1762183600_crop000.jpg
  • 🧱 Material: Plastic
  • 🧩 Shape/Size: Rectangular trays with multiple compartments / Medium to large, designed to hold multiple items
  • 🎨 Color: Dark blue
  • 🧪 State: Used, structurally intact, likely contaminated from medical use
  • 🎯 Purpose: Medical/surgical instrument trays or food service trays. Given the context of the yellow biohazard bag and other items, medical/surgical use is highly probable.
  • 👁 Visibility: Multiple trays are visible, some partially overlapping, but their main features and material are clearly identifiable.
  • 🔍 Other objects: White paper/plastic cup with a biohazard symbol, Clear plastic pouch/film (possibly sterile packaging), White crumpled material (likely paper or textile wipes), Yellow biohazard bag lining the container
  • 🔗 Relationship: All items are discarded together within the yellow biohazard bag, indicating they are part of the same waste stream, likely medical waste. The cup and pouch are resting on or near the plastic trays.
  • 🗂 Category: Plastics: Rigid Plastic Packaging (specifically medical waste due to context)
  • ♻️ Recyclability: Unlikely to be conventionally recyclable due to potential biohazard contamination. These items would typically require special disposal methods such as incineration or autoclaving.
  • 📈 Confidence: A (High: Clear features, high confidence)
  • ❓ Uncertainties: The exact type of plastic (e.g., PP, PS) for the trays is not specified, but it is clearly rigid plastic., The specific level and nature of contamination on the trays are unknown, but assumed to be biohazardous given the disposal context.

— Crop 2 (region 7): crops/scan_1762183600/scan_1762183600_crop001.jpg
  • 🧱 Material: Plastic
  • 🧩 Shape/Size: Irregular, crumpled, bag-like / Large

  • 🧪 State: Intact, appears to be used and discarded
  • 🎯 Purpose: Disposable drinking cup or container for beverages/food
  • 👁 Visibility: Mostly complete, the top rim and bottom edge are slightly cropped, but the main body and label are clearly visible.
  • 🔍 Other objects: Portion of a blue rigid plastic tray/container, Crumpled white material (possibly plastic film or paper), Part of a yellow plastic bag
  • 🔗 Relationship: The primary object (cup) is resting on or next to these secondary items, all contained within a larger yellow plastic bag, indicating they are part of a waste collection.
  • 🗂 Category: Plastics: Other Plastic Containers
  • ♻️ Recyclability: Likely recyclable as a plastic item, but specific recyclability depends on the exact plastic resin type (not specified) and local recycling guidelines.
  • 📈 Confidence: A (High: Clear features, high confidence)
  • ❓ Uncertainties: The specific type of plastic resin (e.g., PP, PS) is not identifiable from the image, which impacts precise recyclability assessment., The exact original contents of the cup are unknown.

— Crop 5 (region 1): crops/scan_1762183600/scan_1762183600_crop004.jpg
